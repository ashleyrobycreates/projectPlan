# projectPlan
<h1>Welcome to my projectPlan!<h1>

<h2>This will be a simple website detailing how to grow a quick vegetable garden including instructions, images, current weather info based on the local of the client, a planting zone for the clients area chart or image. Also included will be a plant identity search and/or a API that will play tunes for plants while they grow via Spotify, as well as research showing how playing music/sound increase the growth health of plants. I've included the attached images of a wireframing mock up to jot down ideas of placements and tasks.
